# Cipher Usability

### This Project Includes:
- Imported string library to access more characters.
- Opening message with the user that describes what the program will do.
- Includes user input for the initialMessage (capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and keyboard symbols), the key, and the mode (encrypt or decrypt).
- Includes a for loop that cycles through each character in the initialMessage.
- Includes a conditional statement that allows for multiple word messages.
- Defines and calls a function called encryptOrDecrypt() that stores a conditional statement to encrypt or decrypt the initialMessage based on user input.
- Defines and calls a function called wraparound() that stores a conditional statement to adjust the position of any wraparound characters.
- Shares the shiftedMessage with the user.
